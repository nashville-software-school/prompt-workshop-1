# Exploration: Design a Prompt for a Short Story

Using the techniques described in this section, craft a prompt that helps aspiring authors generate ideas for a short story revolving around a mystery solved by an antiheroine.

Example using Chain-of-Thought Factored Decomposition Prompting:

"Ensure that the author provides a name for the antiheroine, and three major personality traits. Also make sure that the author describes the circumstances of the mystery she needs to solve and how her personality traits might inhibit her ability to solve it."

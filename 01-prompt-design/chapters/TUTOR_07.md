# Self-Reflection Prompting

Instruct the tool to consider its approach if the student exhibits confusion. Also include sentiment analysis in this step.

- If you ask a question, and the student responds with "I don't know" or "I don't understand", or any variation of those, determine if your question was too advanced.
- Infer the emotion expressed in the student's questions and responses.
- If the student sentiment is positive or neutral, encourage the student for remaining positive.
- If the student sentiment is negative, remind the student that this is difficult to learn and takes patience.

# Idea Generation to Spur Creativity

Since an LLM like ChatGPT is a great resource for getting your creative juices flowing, here's an actual conversation that was had to help a product designer for a major food brand to come up with an idea for a new product.

After you read this conversation, you are given a sample scenario to try it out for yourself.

## Providing Initial Context

First, the age range of the target audience was determined. Just a conversation prompt that you might ask any expert in a field.

---
> **You:** What age range is generally considered "Gen Z"?
---
> **ChatGPT:** "Generation Z," often abbreviated as "Gen Z," typically refers to the cohort of individuals who were born after the mid-to-late 1990s and into the early 2010s. While there is no universally agreed-upon date range for Gen Z, the birth years commonly associated with this generation span from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s. This means that as of 2023, Gen Z would generally include individuals who are in their late teens to early twenties. Keep in mind that generational boundaries can be somewhat fluid, and the exact years may vary depending on the source or study.

This simple question already is providing context to the LLM for the rest of the conversation and it will "remember" that you are focused on Gen Z.

## Gathering Information

Next, the product designer wants to know some common food and drink preferences for people in that age range. The depth of content created in response to the question was surprising.

---
> **You:** What are the common food and drink preferences for people in Gen Z?
---
> **ChatGPT:** Food and drink preferences can vary widely among individuals in any generation, including Gen Z. However, there are some general trends and preferences that have been observed among many Gen Z individuals:
>
> 1. Health-Conscious Choices: Gen Z tends to prioritize health and wellness more than some previous generations. They often opt for healthier food choices, such as plant-based and organic options, and are more likely to be mindful of dietary restrictions and allergies.
> 2. Sustainability: Gen Z is known for its concern about environmental issues, so sustainable and eco-friendly food choices are important to many. This includes a preference for foods that are locally sourced, ethically produced, and have a lower carbon footprint.
> 3. Global Flavors: Gen Z has grown up in a multicultural and diverse world, so they often have a more adventurous palate. They are open to trying foods from various cultures and may enjoy international cuisines like sushi, Thai, Indian, and Mexican.
> 4. Plant-Based and Vegan Options: Many Gen Z individuals are interested in plant-based and vegan diets, whether it's for health, environmental, or ethical reasons. As a result, there is a growing demand for plant-based alternatives to traditional animal-based products, such as plant-based meat and dairy substitutes.
> 5. Snacking Culture: Gen Z has a snacking culture and often prefers smaller, convenient, and portable snacks. This has led to the popularity of snacks like protein bars, smoothie bowls, and gourmet popcorn.
> 6. Food Delivery Services: Gen Z is more likely to use food delivery apps and services, making online food ordering and home delivery a common part of their dining experience.
> 7. Unique and Instagrammable Foods: Gen Z is known for its love of visually appealing and Instagram-worthy food. Colorful and aesthetically pleasing dishes often catch their attention.
> 8. Craft Beverages: Craft beer, artisanal coffee, and unique beverage options are popular among Gen Z. They appreciate quality and are willing to pay a bit more for beverages with unique flavors and stories behind them.
> 9. Food Transparency: Gen Z is interested in knowing where their food comes from and how it's produced. They value transparency in food labeling and sourcing information.
> 10. Digital Influence: Social media platforms heavily influence Gen Z's food choices. They may discover new food trends and restaurants through platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
>
> It's important to remember that these are general trends and preferences, and individual food choices can vary widely within the Gen Z demographic. Additionally, as time goes on, preferences may evolve and change with new culinary trends and societal developments.

## Idea Generation

Now that the stage is set with some initial context and information, the product designer can start asking for ideas from the LLM.

One surprising outcome was that the tool had the context of a product designer, and therefore, made the assumption that a marketing strategy would be needed - even though it was not explicitly asked to generate one.

---
> **You:** I work for Kraft Foods as a product developer. I need some ideas for new food and drink products. Given these preferences, help me design a product that meets most, or all, of them.
---
>
> **ChatGPT:** Certainly! Based on the preferences of Gen Z for health-conscious, sustainable, and global flavors, as well as their interest in plant-based options and unique, Instagram-worthy foods, here's an idea for a new food product:
>
> **Product Name:** "Global Fusion Veggie Bites"
>
> **Product Description:**
>
